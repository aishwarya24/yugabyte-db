The following sections include requirements to install YB Voyager.

## Supported OS versions

You can install YB Voyager on the following Linux distributions:

- CentOS 7
- Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04

## Hardware requirements

- The recommended disk space must be at least 1.5 times the estimated size of the source database.
- 2 cores minimum (recommended)

## Prepare the host

The node where you'll run the yb-voyager command should:

- connect to both the source and the target database.
- have sudo access.

## Create an export directory

yb-voyager uses the directory to store source data, schema files, and the migration state. The file system in which the directory resides must have enough free space to hold the entire source database. Create an export directory in the local file system on the machine where YB Voyager will be installed, and place its path in an environment variable.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/export-dirs/sakila
export EXPORT_DIR=~/export-dirs/sakila
```

Refer to [Export directory](../../yb-voyager/reference/#export-directory), to learn more.
