Delphix is a data operations company that enables organizations to modernize their data infrastructure by providing software solutions for data management and delivery. Some of its key features include data virtualization, data masking, data replication, and data management across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.

- Data Virtualization: Delphix can virtualize YugabyteDB databases by ingesting its data to the Delphix platform, and create lightweight copies of YugabyteDB using sensitive data masking techniques. The resulting virtual copies can then be used for different use cases such as dvelopment, testing, analytics, reporting, and so on.
