When migrating a database, it's prudent to have a backup strategy in case the new database doesn't work as expected. A fall-back approach involves streaming changes from the YugabyteDB (target) database back to the source database after the cutover operation, enabling you to cutover to the source database at any point.

A fall-back approach allows you to test the system end-to-end. This workflow is especially important in heterogeneous migration scenarios, in which source and target databases are using different engines.

## Fall-back workflow

![fall-back](/images/migrate/live-fall-back.png)

At cutover, applications stop writing to the source database and start writing to the target YugabyteDB database. After the cutover process is complete, Voyager keeps the source database synchronized with changes from the target YugabyteDB database as shown in the following illustration:

![cutover](/images/migrate/cutover.png)

Finally, if you need to switch back to the source database (because the current YugabyteDB system is not working as expected), you can switch back your database.

![initiate-cutover-to-source](/images/migrate/fall-back-switchover.png)

The following illustration describes the workflow for live migration using YB Voyager with the fall-back option.

## Prepare the source database

Create a new database user, and assign the necessary user permissions.

1. Create a writer role for the source schema for Voyager to be able to write the changes from the target YugabyteDB database to the source database (in case of a fall-back):

   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE <SCHEMA_NAME>_writer_role;

   BEGIN
       FOR R IN (SELECT owner, object_name FROM all_objects WHERE owner=UPPER('<SCHEMA_NAME>') and object_type ='TABLE' MINUS SELECT owner, table_name from all_nested_tables where owner = UPPER('<SCHEMA_NAME>'))
       LOOP
          EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER on '||R.owner||'."'||R.object_name||'" to  <SCHEMA_NAME>_writer_role';
       END LOOP;
   END;
   /

   DECLARE
      v_sql VARCHAR2(4000);
   BEGIN
      FOR table_rec IN (SELECT table_name FROM all_tables WHERE owner = 'YBVOYAGER_METADATA') LOOP
         v_sql := 'GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON YBVOYAGER_METADATA.' || table_rec.table_name || ' TO <SCHEMA_NAME>_writer_role';
         EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql;
      END LOOP;
   END;
   /

   GRANT CREATE ANY SEQUENCE, SELECT ANY SEQUENCE, ALTER ANY SEQUENCE TO <SCHEMA_NAME>_writer_role;
   ```

1. Assign the writer role to the source database user as follows:

   ```sql
   GRANT <SCHEMA_NAME>_writer_role TO c##ybvoyager;
   ```

      END LOOP;
   END;
   /

   GRANT CREATE ANY SEQUENCE, SELECT ANY SEQUENCE, ALTER ANY SEQUENCE TO <SCHEMA_NAME>_writer_role;
   ```

1. Assign the writer role to the source database user as follows:

   ```sql
   GRANT <SCHEMA_NAME>_writer_role TO ybvoyager;
   ```

  </div>
</div>

If you want yb-voyager to connect to the source database over SSL, refer to [SSL Connectivity](../../reference/yb-voyager-cli/#ssl-connectivity).

{{< note title="Connecting to Oracle instances" >}}
You can use only one of the following arguments to connect to your Oracle instance:

- --source-db-schema (Schema name of the source database.)
- --oracle-db-sid (Oracle System Identifier you can use while exporting data from Oracle instances.)
- --oracle-tns-alias (TNS (Transparent Network Substrate) alias configured to establish a secure connection with the server.)
{{< /note >}}

## Prepare the target database

Prepare your target YugabyteDB database cluster by creating a database, and a user for your cluster.

### Create the target database

Create the target database in your YugabyteDB cluster. The database name can be the same or different from the source database name.

If you don't provide the target database name during import, yb-voyager assumes the target database name is `yugabyte`. To specify the target database name during import, use the `--target-db-name` argument with the `yb-voyager import` commands.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE target_db_name;
```

### Create a user

Create a user with [`SUPERUSER`](../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/dcl_create_role/#syntax) role.

- For a local YugabyteDB cluster or YugabyteDB Anywhere, create a user and role with the superuser privileges using the following command:

     ```sql
     CREATE USER ybvoyager SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password';
     ```

- For YugabyteDB Managed, create a user with [`yb_superuser`](../../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-users/#admin-and-yb-superuser) role using the following command:

     ```sql
     CREATE USER ybvoyager PASSWORD 'password';
     GRANT yb_superuser TO ybvoyager;
     ```

If you want yb-voyager to connect to the target database over SSL, refer to [SSL Connectivity](../../reference/yb-voyager-cli/#ssl-connectivity).

{{< warning title="Deleting the ybvoyager user" >}}

After migration, all the migrated objects (tables, views, and so on) are owned by the `ybvoyager` user. You should transfer the ownership of the objects to some other user (for example, `yugabyte`) and then delete the `ybvoyager` user. Example steps to delete the user are:

```sql
REASSIGN OWNED BY ybvoyager TO yugabyte;
DROP OWNED BY ybvoyager;
DROP USER ybvoyager;
```

{{< /warning >}}

## Create an export directory

yb-voyager keeps all of its migration state, including exported schema and data, in a local directory called the *export directory*.

Before starting migration, you should create the export directory on a file system that has enough space to keep the entire source database. Next, you should provide the path of the export directory as a mandatory argument (`--export-dir`) to each invocation of the yb-voyager command in an environment variable.

```sh
mkdir $HOME/export-dir
export EXPORT_DIR=$HOME/export-dir
```

The export directory has the following sub-directories and files:

- `reports` directory contains the generated *Schema Analysis Report*.
- `schema` directory contains the source database schema translated to PostgreSQL. The schema is partitioned into smaller files by the schema object type such as tables, views, and so on.
- `data` directory contains CSV (Comma Separated Values) files that are passed to the COPY command on the target database.
- `metainfo` and `temp` directories are used by yb-voyager for internal bookkeeping.
- `logs` directory contains the log files for each command.

## Migrate your database to YugabyteDB

Proceed with schema and data migration using the following steps:

### Export and analyze schema

To begin, export the schema from the source database. Once exported, analyze the schema and apply any necessary manual changes.

#### Export schema

The `yb-voyager export schema` command extracts the schema from the source database, converts it into PostgreSQL format (if the source database is Oracle or MySQL), and dumps the SQL DDL files in the `EXPORT_DIR/schema/*` directories.

{{< note title="Usage for source_db_schema" >}}

The `source_db_schema` argument specifies the schema of the source database.

- For Oracle, `source-db-schema` can take only one schema name and you can migrate _only one_ schema at a time.

{{< /note >}}

An example invocation of the command is as follows:

```sh
# Replace the argument values with those applicable for your migration.
yb-voyager export schema --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR> \
        --source-db-type <SOURCE_DB_TYPE> \
        --source-db-host <SOURCE_DB_HOST> \
        --source-db-user <SOURCE_DB_USER> \
        --source-db-password <SOURCE_DB_PASSWORD> \ # Enclose the password in single quotes if it contains special characters.
        --source-db-name <SOURCE_DB_NAME> \
        --source-db-schema <SOURCE_DB_SCHEMA>

```

Refer to [export schema](../../reference/schema-migration/export-schema/) for details about the arguments.

#### Analyze schema

The schema exported in the previous step may not yet be suitable for importing into YugabyteDB. Even though YugabyteDB is PostgreSQL compatible, given its distributed nature, you may need to make minor manual changes to the schema.

The `yb-voyager analyze-schema` command analyses the PostgreSQL schema dumped in the [export schema](#export-schema) step, and prepares a report that lists the DDL statements which need manual changes. An example invocation of the command is as follows:

```sh
# Replace the argument values with those applicable for your migration.
yb-voyager analyze-schema --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR> --output-format <FORMAT>
```

The preceding command generates a report file under the `EXPORT_DIR/reports/` directory.

Refer to [analyze schema](../../reference/schema-migration/analyze-schema/) for details about the arguments.

#### Manually edit the schema

Fix all the issues listed in the generated schema analysis report by manually editing the SQL DDL files from the `EXPORT_DIR/schema/*`.

After making the manual changes, re-run the `yb-voyager analyze-schema` command. This generates a fresh report using your changes. Repeat these steps until the generated report contains no issues.

To learn more about modelling strategies using YugabyteDB, refer to [Data modeling](../../reference/data-modeling/).

{{< note title="Manual schema changes" >}}

- Include the primary key definition in the `CREATE TABLE` statement. Primary Key cannot be added to a partitioned table using the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

{{< /note >}}

### Import schema

Import the schema using the `yb-voyager import schema` command.

{{< note title="Usage for target_db_schema" >}}

`yb-voyager` imports the source database into the `public` schema of the target database. By specifying `--target-db-schema` argument during import, you can instruct `yb-voyager` to create a non-public schema and use it for the schema/data import.

{{< /note >}}

An example invocation of the command is as follows:

```sh
# Replace the argument values with those applicable for your migration.
yb-voyager import schema --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR> \
        --target-db-host <TARGET_DB_HOST> \
        --target-db-user <TARGET_DB_USER> \
        --target-db-password <TARGET_DB_PASSWORD> \ # Enclose the password in single quotes if it contains special characters..
        --target-db-name <TARGET_DB_NAME> \
        --target-db-schema <TARGET_DB_SCHEMA>
```

Refer to [import schema](../../reference/schema-migration/import-schema/) for details about the arguments.

yb-voyager applies the DDL SQL files located in the `$EXPORT_DIR/schema` directory to the target database. If yb-voyager terminates before it imports the entire schema, you can rerun it by adding the `--ignore-exist` option.

{{< note title="Importing indexes and triggers" >}}

Because the presence of indexes and triggers can slow down the rate at which data is imported, by default `import schema` does not import indexes and triggers. You should complete the data import without creating indexes and triggers. Only after data import is complete, create indexes and triggers using the `import schema` command with an additional `--post-import-data` flag.

{{< /note >}}

### Export data

Begin exporting data from the source database into the `EXPORT_DIR/data` directory using the yb-voyager export data command as follows:

```sh
# Replace the argument values with those applicable for your migration.
yb-voyager export data --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR> \
        --source-db-type <SOURCE_DB_TYPE> \
        --source-db-host <SOURCE_DB_HOST> \
        --source-db-user <SOURCE_DB_USER> \
        --source-db-password <SOURCE_DB_PASSWORD> \ # Enclose the password in single quotes if it contains special characters.
        --source-db-name <SOURCE_DB_NAME> \
        --source-db-schema <SOURCE_DB_SCHEMA> \
        --export-type snapshot-and-changes
```

The export data command first ensures that it exports a snapshot of the data already present on the source database. Next, you start a streaming phase (CDC phase) where you begin capturing new changes made to the data on the source after the migration has started. Some important metrics such as the number of events, export rate, and so on, is displayed during the CDC phase similar to the following:

```output
| ---------------------------------------  |  ----------------------------- |
| Metric                                   |                          Value |
| ---------------------------------------  |  ----------------------------- |
| Total Exported Events                    |                         123456 |
| Total Exported Events (Current Run)      |                         123456 |
| Export Rate(Last 3 min)                  |                      22133/sec |
| Export Rate(Last 10 min)                 |                      21011/sec |
| ---------------------------------------  |  ----------------------------- |
```

Note that the CDC phase will start only after a snapshot of the entire table-set is completed.
Additionally, the CDC phase is restartable. So, if yb-voyager terminates when data export is in progress, it resumes from its current state after the CDC phase is restarted.

#### Caveats

- Some data types are unsupported. For a detailed list, refer to [datatype mappings](../../reference/datatype-mapping-oracle/).
- For Oracle where sequences are not attached to a column, resume value generation is unsupported.
- `--parallel-jobs` argument (specifies the number of tables to be exported in parallel from the source database at a time) has no effect on live migration.

Refer to [export data](../../reference/data-migration/export-data/) for details about the arguments of an export operation.

The options passed to the command are similar to the [`yb-voyager export schema`](#export-schema) command. To export only a subset of the tables, pass a comma-separated list of table names in the `--table-list` argument.

#### get data-migration-report

Run the `yb-voyager get data-migration-report --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR>` command to get a consolidated report of the overall progress of data migration concerning all the databases involved (source and target).

Refer to [get data-migration-report](../../reference/data-migration/export-data/#get-data-migration-report-live-migrations-only) for details about the arguments.

### Import data

After you have successfully imported the schema in the target database, you can start importing the data using the yb-voyager import data command as follows:

```sh
# Replace the argument values with those applicable for your migration.
yb-voyager import data --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR> \
        --target-db-host <TARGET_DB_HOST> \
        --target-db-user <TARGET_DB_USER> \
        --target-db-password <TARGET_DB_PASSWORD> \ # Enclose the password in single quotes if it contains special characters.
        --target-db-name <TARGET_DB_NAME> \
        --target-db-schema <TARGET_DB_SCHEMA> \ # Oracle only.
        --parallel-jobs <NUMBER_OF_JOBS>
```

Refer to [import data](../../reference/data-migration/import-data/) for details about the arguments.

For the snapshot exported, yb-voyager splits the data dump files (from the $EXPORT_DIR/data directory) into smaller batches. yb-voyager concurrently ingests the batches such that all nodes of the target YugabyteDB database cluster are used. After the snapshot is imported, a similar approach is employed for the CDC phase, where concurrent batches of change events are applied on the target YugabyteDB database cluster.

Some important metrics such as the number of events, ingestion rate, and so on, is displayed during the CDC phase similar to the following:

```output
| -----------------------------  |  ----------------------------- |
| Metric                         |                          Value |
| -----------------------------  |  ----------------------------- |
| Total Imported events          |                         272572 |
| Events Imported in this Run    |                         272572 |
| Ingestion Rate (last 3 mins)   |               14542 events/sec |
| Ingestion Rate (last 10 mins)  |               14542 events/sec |
| Time taken in this Run         |                      0.83 mins |
| Remaining Events               |                        4727427 |
| Estimated Time to catch up     |                          5m42s |
| -----------------------------  |  ----------------------------- |
```

The entire import process is designed to be _restartable_ if yb-voyager terminates when the data import is in progress. If restarted, the data import resumes from its current state.

{{< note title="Note">}}
The arguments `table-list` and `exclude-table-list` are not supported in live migration.
For details about the arguments, refer to the [arguments table](../../reference/data-migration/import-data/#arguments).
{{< /note >}}

{{< tip title="Importing large datasets" >}}

When importing a very large database, run the import data command in a `screen` session, so that the import is not terminated when the terminal session stops.

If the `yb-voyager import data` command terminates before completing the data ingestion, you can re-run it with the same arguments and the command will resume the data import operation.

{{< /tip >}}

#### get data-migration-report

Run the following  command to get a consolidated report of the overall progress of data migration concerning all the databases involved (source, target, and source-replica).

```sh
yb-voyager get data-migration-report --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR> \
        --target-db-password <TARGET_DB_PASSWORD> \
        --source-db-password <SOURCE_DB_PASSWORD>
```

Refer to [get data-migration-report](../../reference/data-migration/import-data/#get-data-migration-report) for details about the arguments.

### Archive changes (Optional)

As the migration continuously exports changes on the source database to the `EXPORT-DIR`, the disk utilization continues to grow indefinitely over time. To limit usage of all the disk space, optionally, you can use the `archive changes` command as follows:

```sh
yb-voyager archive changes --export-dir <EXPORT-DIR> --move-to <DESTINATION-DIR> --delete
```

Refer to [archive changes](../../reference/cutover-archive/archive-changes/) for details about the arguments.

### Cutover to the target

During cutover, you switch your application over from the source database to the target YugabyteDB database.

Keep monitoring the metrics displayed for export data and import data processes. After you notice that the import of events is catching up to the exported events, you are ready to perform a cutover. You can use the "Remaining events" metric displayed in the import data process to help you determine the cutover.

Perform the following steps as part of the cutover process:

1. Quiesce your source database, that is stop application writes.
1. Perform a cutover after the exported events rate ("ingestion rate" in the metrics table) drops to 0 using the following command:

    ```sh
<<<<<<< HEAD
    yb-voyager initiate cutover to target --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR> --prepare-for-fall-back true
    ```

    Refer to [initiate cutover to target](../../reference/cutover-archive/cutover/#cutover-initiate) for details about the arguments.

    As part of the cutover process, the following occurs in the background:

    1. The initiate cutover to target command stops the export data process, followed by the import data process after it has imported all the events to the target YugabyteDB database.

    1. The [export data from target]() command automatically starts capturing changes from the target YugabyteDB database.
    Note that the [import data](#import-data) process transforms to a `export data from target` process, so if it gets terminated for any reason, you need to restart the synchronization using the `export data from target` command as suggested in the import data output.

    1. The import data to source command automatically starts applying changes (captured from the target YugabyteDB) back to the source database.
    Note that the [export data](#export-data) process transforms to a `export data from target` process, so if it gets terminated for any reason, you need to restart the process using `import data to source` command as suggested in the export data output.

1. Wait for the cutover process to complete. Monitor the status of the cutover process using the following command:

    ```sh
    yb-voyager cutover status --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR>
    ```

    Refer to [cutover status](../../reference/cutover-archive/cutover/#cutover-status) for details about the arguments.

1. Import indexes and triggers using the `import schema` command with an additional `--post-import-data` flag as follows:

    ```sh
    # Replace the argument values with those applicable for your migration.
    yb-voyager import schema --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR> \
            --target-db-host <TARGET_DB_HOST> \
            --target-db-user <TARGET_DB_USER> \
            --target-db-password <TARGET_DB_PASSWORD> \ # Enclose the password in single quotes if it contains special characters.
            --target-db-name <TARGET_DB_NAME> \
            --target-db-user <TARGET_DB_USER> \
            --target-db-schema <TARGET_DB_SCHEMA> \
            --post-import-data <BOOLEAN_VALUE>
    ```

    Refer to [import schema](../../reference/schema-migration/import-schema/) for details about the arguments.

1. Verify your migration. After the schema and data import is complete, the automated part of the database migration process is considered complete. You should manually run validation queries on both the source and target database to ensure that the data is correctly migrated. A sample query to validate the databases can include checking the row count of each table.

1. Disable indexes/triggers and foreign-key/check constraints on the source database to ensure that changes from the target YugabyteDB database can be imported correctly to the source database using the following PLSQL commands on the source schema as a privileged user:

    ```sql
    --disable triggers

    BEGIN
        FOR R IN (SELECT owner, object_name FROM all_objects WHERE owner=UPPER('<SCHEMA_NAME>') and object_type ='TABLE' MINUS SELECT owner, table_name from all_nested_tables where owner = UPPER('<SCHEMA_NAME>'))
        LOOP
           EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER TABLE '||R.owner||'."'||R.object_name||'" DISABLE ALL TRIGGERS';
        END LOOP;
    END;
    /

    --disable referential constraints

    BEGIN
        FOR c IN (SELECT table_name, constraint_name
                FROM user_constraints
                WHERE constraint_type IN ('R') AND OWNER = '<SCHEMA_NAME>')
        LOOP
          EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'ALTER TABLE ' || c.table_name || ' DISABLE CONSTRAINT ' || c.constraint_name;
        END LOOP;
    END;
    /
    ```

### Cutover to the source (Optional)

During this phase, switch your application over from the target YugabyteDB database back to the source database. As this step is _optional_, perform it only if the target YugabyteDB database is not working as expected.

Keep monitoring the metrics displayed for `export data from target` and `import data to source` processes. After you notice that the import of events to the source database is catching up to the exported events from the target database, you are ready to cutover. You can use the "Remaining events" metric displayed in the `import data to source` process to help you determine the cutover.
Perform the following steps as part of the cutover process:

1. Quiesce your target database, that is stop application writes.

1. Perform a cutover after the exported events rate ("export rate" in the metrics table) drops to using the following command:

    ```sh
    yb-voyager initiate cutover to source --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR>
    ```

    Refer to [initiate cutover to source](../../reference/fall-forward/initiate-cutover-to-source/) for details about the arguments.
    The `initiate cutover to source` command stops the `export data from target` process, followed by the `import data to source` process after it has imported all the events to the source database.

1. Wait for the cutover process to complete. Monitor the status of the cutover process using the following command:

    ```sh
    yb-voyager cutover status --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR>
    ```

    Refer to [cutover status](../../reference/cutover-archive/cutover/#cutover-status) for details about the arguments.

1. Re-enable indexes/triggers and foreign-key/check constraints on the source database using the following PLSQL commands on the source schema as a privileged user:

    ```sql
    --enable triggers
    BEGIN

1. Verify your migration. After the schema and data import is complete, the automated part of the database migration process is considered complete. You should manually run validation queries on both the source and target databases to ensure that the data is correctly migrated. A sample query to validate the databases can include checking the row count of each table.

1. Stop [archive changes](#archive-changes-optional).

### End migration

To end the migration, you need to clean up the export directory (export-dir), and Voyager state ( Voyager-related metadata) stored in the target database and source database.

Run the `yb-voyager end migration` command to perform the clean up, and to back up the schema, data, migration reports, and log files by providing the backup related flags (mandatory) as follows:

```sh
yb-voyager end migration --export-dir <EXPORT_DIR>
        --backup-log-files <true, false, yes, no, 1, 0>
        --backup-data-files <true, false, yes, no, 1, 0>
        --backup-schema-files <true, false, yes, no, 1, 0>
        --save-migration-reports <true, false, yes, no, 1, 0>
```

Note that after you end the migration, you will _not_ be able to continue further. If you want to back up the schema, data, log files, and the migration reports (`analyze-schema` report and `get data-migration-report` output) for future reference, the command provides an additional argument `--backup-dir`, using which you can pass the path of the directory where the backup content needs to be saved (based on what you choose to back up).

Refer to [end migration](../../reference/end-migration/) for more details on the arguments.

## Limitations

In addition to the Live migration [limitations](../live-migrate/#limitations), the following additional limitations apply to the fall-back feature:

1. Fall-back is unsupported with a YugabyteDB cluster running on YugabyteDB Managed.
1. SSL Connectivity is unsupported for export or streaming events from YugabyteDB during `export data from target`.
1. In the fall-back phase, you need to manually disable (and subsequently re-enable if required) constraints/indexes/triggers on the source database.
1. yb-voyager provides limited datatypes support with YugabyteDB CDC during `export data from target` for datatypes such as DECIMAL and Timestamp.
