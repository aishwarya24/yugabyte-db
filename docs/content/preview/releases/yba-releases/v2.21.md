### New features

Summary to be added

This is a sample

* Introduces yb_silence_advisory_locks_not_supported_error as a temporary solution, avoiding disruption while users transition from the use of advisory locks. {{<issue 19974>}}
* Shifts from the test gflag "FLAGS_TEST_enable_db_catalog_version_mode" to the {{<badge/tp>}} gflag "FLAGS_ysql_enable_db_catalog_version_mode", enhancing user control over concurrent DDL execution across different databases. {{<issue 12417>}}
* Issues a notice for unsafe ALTER TABLE operations, including for ADD COLUMN...DEFAULT, to indicate existing rows won't be backfilled with the default value, enhancing user awareness. Suppression possible by setting ysql_suppress_unsafe_alter_notice gflag to true. {{<issue 19360>}}
* Added sorting capabilities to BatchNestedLoopJoin to return the rows in the same order as NestedLoopJoin. {{<issue 19589>}}
* Replaces the `ysql_max_read_restart_attempts` and `ysql_max_write_restart_attempts` gflags with `yb_max_query_layer_retries`, applies limit to Read Committed isolation statement retries, and adjusts `retry_backoff_multiplier` and `retry_min_backoff` defaults. {{<issue 20359>}}
* Disallows the creation of a temporary index with a tablespace, preventing client hangs and providing a clear error message for temporary index creation with set tablespace. {{<issue 19368>}}
* Enables index tablespace modification through the `ALTER INDEX SET TABLESPACE` command and regulates column statistics using the `ALTER INDEX ALTER COLUMN SET STATISTICS` command. Also, allows the creation and alteration of materialized views with the specified tablespace. Suppress the beta feature warning by enabling `ysql_beta_feature_tablespace_alteration` flag. {{<issue 6639>}}
* Adds function to log the memory contexts of a specified backend process, enhancing memory usage monitoring and allowing users to troubleshoot memory-related issues more effectively. {{<issue 14025>}}
