What follows are the release notes for the YugabyteDB v2.21 release series. Content will be added as new notable features and changes are available in the patch releases of the YugabyteDB v2.21 release series.

For an RSS feed of all release series, point your feed reader to the [RSS feed for releases](../../index.xml).

{{<warning title="Changes to supported operating systems">}}
YugabyteDB 2024.1.0.0 and newer releases do not support v7 Linux versions (CentOS7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.x), Amazon Linux 2, and Ubuntu 18. If you're currently using one of these Linux versions, upgrade to a supported OS version before installing YugabyteDB v2024.1.0. Refer to [Operating system support](../../../reference/configuration/operating-systems/) for the complete list of supported operating systems.
{{</warning>}}

{{< tip title="New defaults for memory division settings available" >}}

YugabyteDB uses [memory division flags](../../../reference/configuration/yb-master/#memory-division-flags) to specify how memory should be divided between different processes (for example, [YB-TServer](../../../architecture/yb-tserver/) versus [YB-Master](../../../architecture/yb-master/)) on a YugabyteDB node as well as within processes. The current defaults for these flags are suboptimal in many cases. In particular, they provide little memory for PostgreSQL, making them more suited for [YCQL](../../../api/ycql/)-only use cases.

If you are expecting to use any nontrivial amount of YSQL, it is strongly recommended to set [ &#8209;&#8209;use_memory_defaults_optimized_for_ysql](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#use-memory-defaults-optimized-for-ysql) for new v2024.1.x universes. This will change the memory division defaults to better values for [YSQL](../../../api/ysql/) usage, as well as optimize them for the node size. If you are upgrading a universe, you may want to instead review your memory division settings and adjust them if desired; see [best practices](../../../develop/best-practices-ysql/#minimize-the-number-of-tablets-you-need).

In future releases, the memory division settings will be used to determine how many tablet replicas a YB-TServer can safely support; this information will power new alerts warning you about overloading nodes with too many tablet replicas and allow blocking operations that would create too many tablet replicas.

### Highlights

**PostgreSQL Emulation mode**

We're pleased to announce the early access of the new PostgreSQL emulation mode in the 2024.1.0.0 release. This mode enables you to take advantage of many new improvements in both PostgreSQL compatibility and performance parity, thus making it even easier to lift and shift your applications from PostgreSQL to YugabyteDB. When this mode is turned on, YugabyteDB will use the [Read-Committed](../../../architecture/transactions/read-committed/) isolation mode, the [Wait-on-Conflict](../../../architecture/transactions/concurrency-control/#wait-on-conflict) concurrency mode for predictable P99 latencies, and the new Cost Based Optimizer that takes advantage of the distributed storage layer architecture and includes query pushdowns, LSM indexes, and [batched nested loop joins](../../../explore/ysql-language-features/join-strategies/#batched-nested-loop-join-bnl) to offer PostgreSQL like performance.

You can enable the emulation mode by passing the `enable_pg_parity_early_access` flag to [yugabyted](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#yugabyted), when bringing up your cluster.

For example, from your YugabyteDB home directory, run the following command:

```sh
./bin/yugabyted start --enable_pg_parity_early_access
```

**Rollback after Upgrade** {{<badge/ga>}}

Rolling back to the pre-upgrade version if you're not satisfied with the upgraded version is now GA. Refer to the [Rollback phase](../../../manage/upgrade-deployment/#b-rollback-phase) for more information.
