{{< tip title="New defaults for memory division settings available" >}}

YugabyteDB uses [memory division flags](../../../reference/configuration/yb-master/#memory-division-flags) to specify how memory should be divided between different processes (for example, [YB-TServer](../../../architecture/yb-tserver/) versus [YB-Master](../../../architecture/yb-master/)) on a YugabyteDB node as well as within processes. The current defaults for these flags are suboptimal in many cases. In particular, they provide little memory for PostgreSQL, making them more suited for [YCQL](../../../api/ycql/)-only use cases.

If you are expecting to use any nontrivial amount of YSQL, it is strongly recommended to set [ &#8209;&#8209;use_memory_defaults_optimized_for_ysql](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#use-memory-defaults-optimized-for-ysql) for new v2024.1.x universes. This will change the memory division defaults to better values for [YSQL](../../../api/ysql/) usage, as well as optimize them for the node size. If you are upgrading a universe, you may want to instead review your memory division settings and adjust them if desired; see [best practices](../../../develop/best-practices-ysql/#minimize-the-number-of-tablets-you-need).

In future releases, the memory division settings will be used to determine how many tablet replicas a YB-TServer can safely support so you can be aware about preventing overloading nodes with too many tablet replicas.
