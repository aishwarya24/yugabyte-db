### Highlights

Summary to be added

### New features

* Introduces yb_silence_advisory_locks_not_supported_error as a temporary solution, avoiding disruption while users transition from the use of advisory locks. {{<issue 19974>}}
* Shifts from the test gflag "FLAGS_TEST_enable_db_catalog_version_mode" to the {{<badge/tp>}} gflag "FLAGS_ysql_enable_db_catalog_version_mode", enhancing user control over concurrent DDL execution across different databases. {{<issue 12417>}}
* Issues a notice for unsafe ALTER TABLE operations, including for ADD COLUMN...DEFAULT, to indicate existing rows won't be backfilled with the default value, enhancing user awareness. Suppression possible by setting ysql_suppress_unsafe_alter_notice gflag to true. {{<issue 19360>}}
* Added sorting capabilities to BatchNestedLoopJoin to return the rows in the same order as NestedLoopJoin. {{<issue 19589>}}
* Replaces the `ysql_max_read_restart_attempts` and `ysql_max_write_restart_attempts` gflags with `yb_max_query_layer_retries`, applies limit to Read Committed isolation statement retries, and adjusts `retry_backoff_multiplier` and `retry_min_backoff` defaults. {{<issue 20359>}}
* Disallows the creation of a temporary index with a tablespace, preventing client hangs and providing a clear error message for temporary index creation with set tablespace. {{<issue 19368>}}
* Enables index tablespace modification through the `ALTER INDEX SET TABLESPACE` command and regulates column statistics using the `ALTER INDEX ALTER COLUMN SET STATISTICS` command. Also, allows the creation and alteration of materialized views with the specified tablespace. Suppress the beta feature warning by enabling `ysql_beta_feature_tablespace_alteration` flag. {{<issue 6639>}}
* Adds function to log the memory contexts of a specified backend process, enhancing memory usage monitoring and allowing users to troubleshoot memory-related issues more effectively. {{<issue 14025>}}

#### YSQL

* Introduces yb_silence_advisory_locks_not_supported_error as a temporary solution, avoiding disruption while users transition from the use of advisory locks. {{<issue 19974>}}
* Shifts from the test gflag "FLAGS_TEST_enable_db_catalog_version_mode" to the {{<badge/tp>}} gflag "FLAGS_ysql_enable_db_catalog_version_mode", enhancing user control over concurrent DDL execution across different databases. {{<issue 12417>}}

Suppress the beta feature warning by enabling `ysql_beta_feature_tablespace_alteration` flag. {{<issue 6639>}}
* Adds function to log the memory contexts of a specified backend process, enhancing memory usage monitoring and allowing users to troubleshoot memory-related issues more effectively. {{<issue 14025>}}

#### DocDB

* Allows customizing retryable request timeouts to respect client-side YCQL and YSQL timings, optimizing log replay and preventing the tserver from rejecting requests that exceed durations. Adjusts default retryable request timeout to 660 seconds and offers a configuration to eliminate server-side retention of retryable requests with `FLAGS_retryable_request_timeout_secs =0`. {{<issue 18736>}}
* Speeds up TServer Init by optimizing the handling of deleted and tombstoned tablets. It ensures faster startup by using a new flag `num_open_tablets_metadata_simultaneously`, which sets the number of threads for opening tablet metadata. This allows for parallel opening of metadata, improving response times even in cases with large numbers of tablets. Additionally, the handling of tablets marked as `Deleted` or `Tombstoned` is managed asynchronously, marking tombstoned tablets as dirty for inclusion in the next heartbeat. {{<issue 15088>}}
* Logs all instances of tablet metadata creation/updation, enabling additional insights for troubleshooting in cases of multiple meta records for the same tablet. {{<issue 20042>}}
* Adds a 10-second delay (`auto_flags_apply_delay_ms`) between AutoFlag config updates and their application, allowing all tservers to receive the new config before applying it. This change enhances configuration consistency and update safety. {{<issue 19932>}}
* Enhances thread safety by setting `Wthread-safety-reference` to check when guarded members are passed by reference and resolving all build errors resulting from this change. {{<issue 19365>}}
* Automates recovery of index tables impacted by a bug, preventing performance degradation and disk size leak, by ensuring schema.table_properties.retain_delete_markers is reset to false when index backfilling is done. {{<issue 19731>}}
* Enhances the `demote_single_auto_flag` yb-admin command by returning distinct error messages for invalid process_name, flag_name, or non-promoted flag, thereby aiding easier identification of errors. Replaces `HasSubstring` with `ASSERT_STR_CONTAINS` in the AutoFlags yb-admin test. {{<issue 20004>}}
* Introduces support for Upgrade and Downgrade of universes with xCluster links, enhancing compatibility checks for AutoFlags during these operations. Data replication between two universes is only catered if AutoFlags of the Target universe are compatible with the Source universe. The compatibility check, stored in `ProducerEntryPB`, triggers if the AutoFlag configuration changes during upgrades and rollbacks. This prevents unnecessary RPC calls if no AutoFlag configurations have changed. Also includes fixes for cds initialization bugs in `TestThreadHolder`. {{<issue 19518>}}
* Offers redesigned server level aggregation for metrics, thus introducing more metrics for enhanced debugging. Removes several unused URL parameters and makes the new output compatible with YBA and YBM, preventing double-counting issues in charts. Drops unused JSON and Prometheus callbacks from MetricEntity for a cleaner design. {{<issue 18078>}}
* Allows a limit on the addition of new tablet replicas in a cluster to conserve CPU resources, with safeguards for downscaling. Introduces test flags for controlling memory reservation and tablet replica per core limits. {{<issue 16177>}}
* Introduces verbose logging for global and per table state transitions in the load balancer to facilitate easier debugging. {{<issue 20289>}}
* Reduces server initialization time by eliminating the accumulation of deleted tablet superblocks during startup, through a modification in the `DeleteTablet` operation. {{<issue 19840>}}
* Enables automatic recovery of index tables affected by a bug, verifying their backfilling status and correcting the `retain_delete_markers` property to enhance performance. {{<issue 20247>}}
* Includes single shard (fast-path) transactions in the pg_locks by querying single shard waiters registered with the local waiting transaction registry at the corresponding Tserver, ensuring more complete transaction tracking and lock status reporting. {{<issue 18195>}}
* Creates Prometheus metrics for server hard and soft memory limits which allow detailed insight into TServer or master memory usage regardless of Google flag defaults; aids in creating dashboards charts to monitor utilization close to soft limit or TServer TCMalloc overhead. {{<issue 20578>}}
* Enables control over the batching of non-deferred indexes during backfill via a new flag, improving index management. {{<issue 20213>}}
