## Highlights- YBA

- Single-table restores in YCQL are now possible, including backups from the entire database. Previously, such restores required table-by-table backups.
Benefits: Higher efficient backups, flexible fine-grain restores, and simplified user experience.

- [YugabyteDB Anywhere Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/yugabyte/yba/latest) generally available. Use HashiCorp Terraform to automate provisioning, lifecycle, and other workflows to reduce costs and time.
Benefits: Increased productivity, predictability, and control.

- YugabyteDB Anywhere is now supported on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 15 SP4

- YugabyteDB Anywhere now deploys a new [node agent]() service on every node and proxies all communication to database processes via this service.
Benefits: YugabyteDB Anywhere no longer requires SSH and SCP except for initial provisioning and node debugging.

- GCP universes can now be created based on user-provided, nearly fully customizable [instance templates](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-templates).
Benefits: Several customizations are possible such as GCP encrypted memory and disk, TPM, solo tenancy, and so on.

- For self-signed certificates generated by YugabyteDB Anywhere, the "organization name" can now be specified explicitly via a YugabyteDB runtime configuration setting.
